# Anemos brand mark

The **Threaded Bezel** — an 8-point **wind rose** (άνεμος is Greek for wind,
the thing every journey rides on) in sun-bronze (`#D2A24C`), set inside a
mariner's compass bezel with a tick ring and crossed south-west to north-east
by a straight azure route line (`#236684`): **instrument outside, journey
inside**. Meltemi palette. It is an organic vector drawing, not a polygon
recipe — edit it in a vector tool, not by hand-computing points. The old
horse-in-horseshoe mark retired with the Golden Tempo name; the chat agent
persona is **Ana**, short for Anemos.

Both marks come from the same 2026-08 exploration and the bare rose shipped
first. `mark-thread-backup.svg` is that one — the **Waypoint Thread rose**,
bare, threaded west→northeast with a waypoint dot. It is the airier and more
ownable drawing and remains the better answer wherever the mark is large and
alone, but it lost the app: its ink filled only 76% of its artboard, so every
surface painted it a quarter smaller than the size it asked for and it read
timid in chrome. The bezel fills 94%. Kept, unrendered, as the approved
alternate.

`mark.svg` is the icon and the **single source of truth** — `lockup.svg`
references it (`<image href="mark.svg">`) and adds the "ANEMOS" wordmark as
live Cormorant Garamond SemiBold text — a static w600 instance of the
variable font, subsetted (font declared *inside* the SVG, loaded from
`src/packages/flutter-app/assets/fonts/`). Cormorant Garamond HAS a true
lowercase; the approved wordmark is full caps, so the caps come from the
string itself. Because of that external reference + live text, always render
via the pipeline below, never by loading lockup.svg as a plain `<img>`.

`mark-light.svg` is the **reversed variant for teal fields** (the boot
splash): the bezel ring, its ticks and the route thread are recolored white —
the dark mark's azure would sink into the teal gradient rather than stand on
it — while the bronze rose is shared with mark.svg unchanged. It duplicates
mark.svg's geometry — a geometry change in one must be mirrored in the other
(both headers say so).

**Plate policy (v3): the mark always floats bare.** No plate is drawn anywhere
in the app. The only question a surface asks is which cut it needs: neutral
page surfaces and scrimmed imagery take the dark `mark`; the teal
`brandGradient` fields — the splash **and the gradient app bar** — take
`mark-light`. v2 kept a white plate on gradient app bars; it was retired
because that gradient does not change with theme, so the plate stayed white in
dark mode and became the brightest object on the screen.

**The bezel ring is not a plate.** A plate is opaque, drawn by the app, sits
behind the mark and has to answer to the theme. The ring is transparent-backed
line work inside the artwork: it ships in the SVG, recolors with the two cuts,
and lets the surface show through its middle. The policy still forbids exactly
what it was written to forbid — it is stated in
`lib/widgets/brand_logo.dart`, so re-litigate it there.

Two artifacts outside the app keep a baked-in plate on purpose: `web/og-card.png`
(lands on arbitrary social backgrounds) and `web/icons/Icon-maskable-512.png`
(the maskable spec requires an opaque field). The print packet's header keeps
one too — see `print_view_handler.go`.

## Type

Two faces doing three jobs, declared once in
`flutter-app/lib/theme/app_typography.dart` (`AppFonts`) and bundled as
subsetted TTFs — never `google_fonts`, which prod CSP blocks:

- **Cormorant Garamond w600** (`AppFonts.wordmark`) — the wordmark: full caps
  "ANEMOS". The caps come from the string (`AppInfo.name.toUpperCase()` in
  `BrandWordmark`), never from `text-transform` alone — the face has a true
  lowercase.
- **Cormorant Garamond w500** (`AppFonts.display`) — headings and app-bar page
  titles. The same family one weight down, so the heading tier and the brand
  sit in one register instead of two that have to be reconciled. It was
  Marcellus until 2026-08, chosen for the *Cinzel* wordmark's register and
  left mismatched when the wordmark moved; matching the wordmark exactly
  removed the pairing question and took the app from three faces to two.
  Sizes carry an optical correction — every display size × **1.295**
  (`kDisplayOpticalScale`, Marcellus's 0.500 em x-height over Cormorant's
  0.386), giving 44/39/34 headline, 28 app-bar title, 28 pinned section
  heading. Same typography, new face.
- **Inter** — body, labels, buttons, and every number, including the big values
  in stat tiles (which opt out of the heading face explicitly).

Both Cormorant weights are static instances of the variable font,
Latin-subsetted to the same coverage (ASCII + Latin-1 + Latin Extended-A +
punctuation); Greek falls back to system faces by design. One `pubspec.yaml`
family entry carries both — a second entry would let the two drift.

**The One Weight Rule** follows from there: the family ships exactly two real
files, so each `AppFonts` constant has one legal weight and every style naming
the family states it explicitly, or the web synthesizes faux-bold and smears
the serif. `check.sh` rule 7 enforces it per constant.

Only the wordmark face is baked into rasters (`anemos_logo.png`,
`og-card.png`); a heading face change needs no re-render and no `?v=` bump.

**Stale, awaiting a follow-up refresh:** `anemos-brand-guidelines.pdf` still
describes the previous identity (the geometric teal/gold rose). Treat this
README and `brand-guidelines.html` v1.5 as current.

## Rendering pipeline (committed — do not run rasterizers ad hoc)

```
./scripts/brand-render.sh                                # repo root
cd src/packages/flutter-app
dart run flutter_native_splash:create                    # native launch screens
dart run flutter_launcher_icons                          # all app icons
```

`brand-render.sh` drives headless Chrome (transparent screenshots) + `sips`
through the harnesses in `docs/branding/render/*.html`. **Every raster asset
below is generated — edit the SVGs or harnesses, never the PNGs.**

| Rendered via | File | Size |
|---|---|---|
| render/mark.html | `flutter-app/assets/images/anemos_mark.png` | 540 |

| render/mark-light.html | `flutter-app/assets/images/anemos_mark_light.png` | 540 |
| render/mark-light.html | `flutter-app/web/splash/anemos_mark_light.png` (copy) | 540 |
| render/mark-light.html (shrunk, 4× the 128dp splash mark) | `flutter-app/assets/splash/mark_light_4x.png` | 512 |
| render/splash-android12.html (741 mark in the 768 circle) | `flutter-app/assets/splash/mark_light_android12.png` | 1152 |
| render/icon84.html (913 → ink at 84%, transparent) | `flutter-app/web/icons/Icon-192/512.png` | 384 / 1024 |
| render/maskable.html (790 → ink inside the 80% safe circle, white) | `flutter-app/web/icons/Icon-maskable-192/512.png` | 384 / 1024 |
| render/lockup.html | `flutter-app/assets/images/anemos_logo.png` | 1024 |
| render/ogcard.html (teal gradient + tagline) | `flutter-app/web/og-card.png` | 1200×630 |
| ↳ flutter_native_splash (from the mark_light seeds) | iOS LaunchImage*, Android `splash.png`/`android12splash.png` (+night) | ladders |
| ↳ flutter_launcher_icons (from Icon-maskable-512) | iOS/Android/macOS/Windows app icons | ladders |

Historical gotcha this table exists to prevent: og-card and badge_4x were
missing from the old README's table, so they silently kept two-brands-ago art
(a metronome!) through two renames. If you add a brand asset, add its row.

**Reading the crop percentages.** A percentage here is ambiguous unless it says
what it measures — the artboard, or the ink on it. Every icon harness used to
measure the artboard, which was wrong by a quarter under the previous mark and
is the reason they shipped a 64% PWA icon and a 48.6% maskable while their
names claimed 84% and 64%. They now state the number they actually control.

The two constants that drive them, measured on the rendered art:

| | Threaded Bezel (`mark.svg`) | bare rose (`mark-thread-backup.svg`) |
|---|---|---|
| ink as a fraction of the artboard | **0.942** | 0.760 |
| furthest ink radius ÷ drawn width | **0.5185** | 0.5710 |

The bezel wins on both, which is why it ships: it is fuller *and* radially
tighter. The bare rose looked compact but flung two hairline thread tails
diagonally toward the artboard corners, so it was simultaneously mostly empty
and hard to fit inside a circle.

Two rules fall out:

- **Unmasked surfaces** (favicon, PWA icon) size to the ink. The bezel needs no
  crop at all for the favicon; the bare rose needed a dedicated 125% harness to
  reach the same place.
- **Masked surfaces** (maskable, Android 12 splash) size to the ink's furthest
  *radius* from centre, **not** its bounding-box width. The rose's cardinal
  blades punch through the bezel and the thread overshoots it, so the ink
  reaches past the artboard's own inscribed circle — a width reading was tried
  on the previous mark and put 508 pixels outside the safe zone.

Cache note: `/app/icons/*` is served `no-cache` (nginx), so a changed icon
propagates on the next load without help. It used to be `immutable` for a year,
which is why the `?v=N` query exists in `web/index.html`, `web/manifest.json`
and `print_view_handler.go` — those are now belt-and-braces rather than the
mechanism, and are still worth bumping for anything a browser may have cached
from before 2026-08-15. (The `immutable` header was removed because Flutter
does not content-hash these filenames; see
`dockerize/deployment/nginx/snippets/app-locations.conf`.)

"Propagates on the next load without help" holds only for objects the CDN
stored **after** 2026-08-15. A stored response keeps the freshness lifetime it
was stored with, so anything Cloudflare cached under the old `immutable` header
sits there until 2027 whatever the origin now sends — correcting a header never
evicts. `scripts/verify-edge-parity.sh` is what catches that; a purge is what
fixes it (runbook in `dockerize/production/README.md`).
