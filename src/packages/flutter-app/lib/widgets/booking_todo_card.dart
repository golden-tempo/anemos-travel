///
/// The complaint this exists to answer: the three arrived as three peers of
/// equal weight, so nothing said which was which. The fix is a weight LADDER,
/// not fewer elements — the checkbox is behaviour (a filter test counts one
/// per row, and it is the thing a traveler came to flip) and the named action
/// is what the row is FOR ("Find ferries" vs "Open in Airbnb" is real
/// information, pinned by ~27 assertions). So:
///
///   * the action is a LINK, not a button — full button padding at primary
///     strength made it louder than the row's own title, and heavier than the
///     very same action on the [BookingDetailRow] nested underneath it, which
///     is a bare 18px glyph. It keeps teal: brand reserves that for identity
///     and the primary action, and this is the row's primary action.
///   * the overflow sits tight against it, so the two read as one group of
///     things-you-can-do rather than as two more peers.
///   * a deliberate gap then separates STATE, so the checkbox reads as its own
///     column instead of as the third item in an undifferentiated run.
///
/// [alignment] is centerRight on the action so that if a short label ever hits
/// the button's minimum width the slack lands on the LEFT — which is what
/// keeps every row's `open_in_new` glyph on one column
/// (trip_detail_booking_alignment_test).
