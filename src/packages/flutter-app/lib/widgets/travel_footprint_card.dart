/// The body of the "Your travels" section on the trips list: a world map
/// pinning every hub city across the user's owned trips, captioned by the
/// travel stats. One merged card (not separate stats + map bands) so the
/// sparse one-trip-each-way page gains a single substantial scroll stop, and
/// so the whole block shares one gating story: with no located cities the map
/// sub-band collapses and the card degrades to a bare stats strip.
///
/// **Map, then caption** — the editorial redesign's shape for this card. The
/// stats used to be a 2×3 grid of big centered numbers under the map, which
/// was both the brand doc's banned hero-metric template and the reason the
/// card read flat: an image with a dashboard bolted to it. They are now two
/// quiet caption lines ([StatTileRow]), so the map is the card's one statement
/// and the numbers annotate it — and the card gets materially shorter, which
/// is the other half of the answer to "maps dominate this page". The map's own
/// height is unchanged: the fix was never to grow the image.
///
/// **Traveled and planned are separate, labeled groups**, and the map says
/// which pins are which (filled = been there, hollow = still ahead). The band
/// reported one all-time total until 2026-08-14, which counted a trip starting
/// next month as travel already taken — 40 "travel days" when 2 had happened.
/// This card sits exactly where the page turns from plans to history, so its
/// numbers have to name which of the two they are. A group whose trip count is
/// zero does not render at all: that one rule is why a brand-new planner never
/// meets a row of zeros, and why nothing here needs a second display mode.
///
/// **Unlabeled by design** — the "Your travels" title is a page-level
/// SectionHeader the caller renders directly above, under the same gate.
/// This card carried its own in-card header until 2026-08-14; that read as
/// clutter-avoidance at the time but cost more than it saved, because a map
/// over an info panel IS the "Up next" hero's silhouette. With the only label
/// tucked *under* the map, the eye hit an unlabeled map inside a run of trip
/// cards and parsed the whole thing as another upcoming trip. A section's
/// label has to sit outside and above its visual, not inside it.
///
/// Neutral [Card] chrome on purpose — the brand gradient stays reserved for
/// the two promoted cards (live spotlight, "Up next" hero). Pins come from
/// the list payload (footprintPins over Trip.cityPins), never from the
/// per-trip detail cache — unlike TripMapBand this band must render for
/// trips never opened on this device.
