/// It REPLACES the trip's plain list card — a promoted trip is never listed
/// twice. It used to sit above the list AND stay in it ("a shortcut, not a
/// filter"), which was defensible while the list below was one flat run
/// called "My Trips" and this card carried nothing the row did; once the list
/// grew sections, that left a trip already under way filed under "Upcoming".
/// The card earns the replacement by carrying the row's facts: [TripHeroCard]
/// is the shared body, and everything below is the two-line difference
/// between this hero and the pre-trip one, [UpNextTripCard].
