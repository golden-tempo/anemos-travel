/// Anemos brand mark: the Threaded Bezel — an 8-point sun-bronze wind rose
/// (άνεμος = wind, #D2A24C) inside a mariner's compass bezel with a tick ring,
/// crossed south-west to north-east by a straight azure route line (#236684):
/// instrument outside, journey inside. Source SVGs live in docs/branding/;
/// PNGs are rendered by scripts/brand-render.sh. (The old horse mark retired
/// with the Golden Tempo name; the chat agent persona is "Ana", short for
/// Anemos.)
///
/// It replaced the bare Waypoint Thread rose (kept as
/// `docs/branding/mark-thread-backup.svg`), and the reason is arithmetic
/// rather than taste: that drawing's ink filled only 76% of its square
/// artboard — the rest was the route thread's hairline tails, which antialias
/// to nothing below ~48px — so every call site here painted a mark a quarter
/// smaller than the number it passed. The bezel fills 94%. Sizes throughout
/// the app were re-derived against that when it landed; **a box size is not
/// comparable across the two drawings**, so do not port a number from git
/// history without multiplying it through.
/// Three forms:
/// - [BrandLogo.lockup] — the full rose + "Anemos" wordmark image. Currently
///   unused: the wordmark is live text ([BrandWordmark]) everywhere, and this
///   PNG's art sits off-centre on a square canvas, so reintroducing it hangs
///   ~7pt of dead space below the mark.
/// - [BrandLogo.mark] — the rose icon only, for neutral chrome and page
///   surfaces (the app bar, nav rail, auth screen).
/// - [BrandLogo.markLight] — the reversed cut (bezel ring, ticks and thread in
///   white; bronze rose unchanged), for teal fields (the boot splash — the
///   last one standing after the de-gradient pass took the app bar to
///   neutral surface).
///
/// The word itself is [BrandWordmark], not part of this class — see there.
///
/// **Plate policy, v3: the mark always floats bare.** No plate is drawn
/// anywhere in the app; the only question a surface asks is which cut of the
/// mark it needs. Neutral chrome and page surfaces (app bar, nav rail, auth
/// screen) take the dark [BrandLogo.mark]; the splash's teal field takes
/// [BrandLogo.markLight], because the dark artwork's azure bezel would sink
/// into the teal there rather than stand on it.
///
/// v2 kept a white `BrandBadge` plate on gradient app bars. v3 retired it: the
/// gradient behind it never changes with theme, so the plate was white in dark
/// mode too, where it was the brightest object on the screen — and the splash
/// had already shown (PR #390) that the reversed mark reads on this exact
/// gradient unaided. Re-litigate the policy here, not at a call site.
///
/// **The bezel ring is not a plate, and the distinction is the whole policy.**
/// A plate is opaque, drawn by the app, sits *behind* the mark, and has to
/// answer to the theme — which is exactly how v2's white badge ended up being
/// the brightest thing in dark mode. The ring is transparent-backed line work
/// inside the artwork itself: it ships in the SVG, recolors with the mark's
/// two cuts, and lets the surface show through its middle. Nothing here draws
/// a container. So this policy still forbids what it was written to forbid —
/// do not read the ring as permission to reintroduce a badge.
