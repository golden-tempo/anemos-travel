/// to 420px and a 1000px window opened on the header, the map, the tab row and
/// exactly one city heading, with the first day below the fold on the page
/// whose job is the days. 280 keeps the card comfortably cinematic at the

/// tab row's below (#503 moved the selected tab's underline onto that lower
/// rule so the tabs read as the head of the list). With 12 above and 12 below
/// the map card read as *centred between* those two rules rather than as
/// belonging to either, and the seam the tab row needs was indistinguishable
/// from the sliver of scaffold under the app bar — most obviously in dark,
/// where a bright satellite card is letterboxed by two identical strips of
/// near-black.
///
/// Unequal says which way the card leans: the map hangs off the top chrome it
/// pins with, and the larger gap below is the seam before the tab row and the
/// list it heads. The pair still totals the same 24, so this costs the
/// itinerary nothing and leaves #503's 420→304 argument exactly where it was.
///
/// The gap above is the PINNED figure only. On phones the band is not chrome —
