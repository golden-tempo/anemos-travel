///
/// It used to be a row of equal-width tiles, each a big value stacked over a
/// small label. That is the brand doc's named anti-pattern (the hero-metric
/// template) and it read as a dashboard panel bolted under the footprint map:
/// three centered columns of chrome for what is, in the end, a caption. The
/// line form applies the house rule instead — below the headline, hierarchy is
/// **weight, not size** — so the same facts read as one sentence of numbers
/// under an image, the way a plate caption reads in a journal.
///
/// The widget still formats and pluralizes NOTHING: values arrive
/// pre-formatted and the l10n plural is resolved at the call site, so a label
/// is printed exactly as handed over. It stays a [Wrap], not a [Row]: the es
/// labels run long, and at 300px three stats have to fall onto a second line
/// rather than ellipsize into uselessness. Four stats — the caption since
/// countries joined it — make that the normal case on a phone rather than the
/// narrow-width exception, which is the whole reason the run spacing exists.
