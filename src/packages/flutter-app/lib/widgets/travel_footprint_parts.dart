/// The two pieces the trips-list footprint band and the travel atlas both
/// paint. They live here rather than privately inside `travel_footprint_card`
/// because the atlas needs the SAME treatment on a different surface, and a
/// second copy of either would drift: the dot's filled-vs-hollow reading is
/// the map's whole legend, and the group's label weight is what keeps the
/// caption quieter than the section header above it.
///
/// The maps themselves are deliberately not shared. The band's camera is
/// static (a panning map mid-scroll steals the page's scroll gesture) while
/// the atlas is pan-and-zoom; one widget with an interaction flag would hide
/// that difference rather than state it.

/// An unnumbered city dot: the _Pin family's white-ring-and-shadow treatment
/// over satellite imagery, brand primary, no ordinal.
///
/// [visited] changes only the FILL — brand primary for a city already
/// travelled, hollow (a dark translucent core) for one still ahead: the
/// filled-vs-empty idiom, and the same reading as a ticked box. The white ring
/// and shadow stay on both so the two are equally findable on busy imagery.
///
/// Swapping the ring colour instead was tried first and inverted the emphasis:
/// at 12px a primary ring on a white core just reads "white dot", which shouts
/// louder than the teal one — the trips you HAVEN'T taken became the loud
/// pins in a section headed by the ones you have. Both stay hardcoded white
/// rather than a surface token: these sit on satellite imagery, which looks
/// the same in either app theme, so a theme-following ring would vanish.
