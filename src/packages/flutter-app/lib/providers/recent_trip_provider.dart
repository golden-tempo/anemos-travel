/// had no map at all.** First-run, a fresh browser profile, cleared site data,
/// or MRU eviction all produced a flat brand slab where the route should be,
/// and nothing on Home could ever fix it, because only the trip screen writes
/// that cache.
///
/// A fetch is the only way out: the trips LIST payload carries no items and no
/// coordinates (listTripsHandler sends them nil), so there is nothing on Home
/// to derive a map from.
///

///  * Only on a miss. A warm cache never reaches the network.
///  * The result is written back, so the next cold start is warm — for every
///    other band on this trip too.
