/// page turns from plans to history, so its numbers have to say which is which.
///
/// Every trip lands on exactly one side, so under the card's 2+ owned trips
/// gate at least one side always has something to show:
///
/// - **Trips** — traveled once the trip has started ([tripHasStarted]); future
///   trips and undated drafts are planned.
/// - **Travel days** — traveled counts only days already lived through
///   ([traveledDayCount]), so an in-progress trip's counter ticks up daily
///   instead of banking all 35 days on day one; planned counts the full span
///   ([dayCount]) of trips that haven't started. The remaining days of an
///   in-progress trip land on neither side: each side stays internally
///   consistent with the trips shown beside it, which is the arithmetic a
///   reader can actually check, and the old grand total is no longer on screen.
/// - **Cities** — deduped case- and whitespace-insensitively, with **traveled
///   winning** the overlap, so a city on both a past and a future trip counts
///   once and counts as visited. The two counts partition rather than
///   double-count, matching the map's two pin styles.
/// - **Countries** — the distinct [CityPin.country] codes, same traveled-wins
///   partition. Read off the PINS, not the city names: the country is a fact
///   the server derives from the coordinate (countryForPoint), and a city
///   without a coordinate has no country to contribute — the same city that
///   already draws no dot. That makes `countries <= pins <= cities` hold by
///   construction, which is the arithmetic a reader can check on the card.
///   Zero when the payload predates the field, and the caption drops the stat.
