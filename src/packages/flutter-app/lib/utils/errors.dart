/// Maps a caught error to a short, localized, user-facing message so raw
/// [ApiException] dumps never reach a snackbar or error banner.
///
/// - An [ApiException] is classified by HTTP status: network (statusCode 0),
///   an expired/forbidden session (401/403), rate limiting (429), a server
///   fault (5xx), or a generic fallback for everything else.
/// - An [AuthException] is classified the same way, except 401 means the
///   credentials were wrong (the user isn't signed in yet, so "session
///   expired" would be nonsense) and 409 means the email already has an
///   account.
/// - A plain [String] is assumed to already be user-facing — e.g. a friendly
///   error the `/plan` SSE stream sent — and is returned unchanged.
/// - Anything else falls back to the generic message; the raw object is never
///   surfaced to the user.
