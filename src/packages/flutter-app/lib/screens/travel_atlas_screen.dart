/// The plate's height below the wide seam.
///
/// Measured, not picked between the wireframe's 280 and `_GuideMap`'s shipped
/// 240 — and measured **in the running app**, because the thing being measured
/// is where text lands, and widget tests lay out with Flutter's fixed-width
/// test font rather than Inter. A number taken from a widget test would not be
/// a number about this app.
///
/// The binding case is the smallest phone this app supports (375×667) carrying
/// the tallest chrome this screen can have — the year chip row above a
/// colophon rendering BOTH groups — and, crucially, **under the shell's
/// [NavigationBar]**, whose 80px means the fold sits ~80px above the viewport
/// floor. Each index row is 49 tall, so the candidates differ only in what
/// survives that fold:
///
///   * **280** — the heading, with the first row's text under the bar.
///   * **256** — the heading and one row, nothing after it.
///   * **240** — the heading and one whole row, the second beginning right at
///     the bar: the most a phone this small has room to promise.
///
/// So 240 — which is also, independently, the height this app already ships
/// for an interactive map inside a scrolling column (`_GuideMap`), so the
/// atlas introduces no third map size. It is genuinely tight at 667pt and
/// comfortable everywhere else: a 390×844 phone shows the heading and FOUR
/// whole rows with a fifth cut by the bar. Going shorter to buy the smallest
/// phone a second row would cost every other phone the map room this screen
/// exists to give.
///
/// The screen's test pins this constant and the order of what follows it —
/// both font-independent. The fold numbers above are browser measurements and
/// deliberately are not asserted anywhere: a pixel claim about text in a
/// widget test would be a claim about the test font.

/// closing the page — because the case for this screen is **size and focus**,
/// not impossibility: a 140px band is a thumbnail of the whole planet, and no
/// gesture policy fixes that. Growing the band instead would mean promoting
/// the retrospective above the plans, which is the ordering PR #488 settled.
///
/// Three elements, top to bottom:
///
///  1. **The plate** — satellite tiles under the same footprint pins, pan and
///     zoom, and **no text on the image**. That last one is a brand
///     requirement rather than a preference: text on satellite would need a
///     scrim, and `heroScrim` over imagery is a teal-tinted photo — a named
///     instant finding. With the caption on paper below, the question does
///     not arise, which is also where a journal actually puts a plate caption.
///  2. **The colophon** — [travelStats] unchanged, traveled/planned split
///     intact, rendered by the same [TravelStatGroup] the band uses. A group
///     whose trip count is zero still doesn't render.
///  3. **The index** — [atlasRows]: **past trips only** ([tripIsPast]),
///     complete, newest first, no cap. Planned trips stay on the map as hollow
///     pins and stay out of here: the map is *everywhere*, the index is
