/// Builds the journey-endpoint overlay for a trip-map surface: the airports
/// this trip departs from and returns into, as pins with dashed legs. Usually
/// one entry — most trips leave and return through the same airport — and two
/// when they differ (out of ALB, home into EWR). Empty while the IATA →
/// coordinate lookup is pending or failed, and each end resolves INDEPENDENTLY:
/// one code that resolves still draws its pin when the other doesn't.
///
/// The outbound leg belongs to the FIRST city leg and the return leg to the
/// LAST, so a mid-trip city focus shows no orphan pin ([focusedLegIndex] null =
/// All shows both; a stale key resolved to -1 shows neither, which is safe
/// because a stale focus also empties the item list). Shared by the full-screen
/// map and the inline trip-detail card so both surfaces gate identically.
///
/// This returns the CANDIDATES — what the overlay would draw. The traveler's
/// session show/hide choice ([homeOverlayChoiceProvider], defaulted per form
/// factor through [homeOverlayVisible]) is applied by both call sites to this
/// one result, and the toggle button renders only while the candidates are
/// non-empty — so availability, drawing, and the choice can never disagree.
/// The choice is deliberately not folded in here: the hosts need the
/// candidates either way (a hidden overlay still decides whether the button
/// exists), and the [homeAirportPointProvider] watch stays warm while hidden.
