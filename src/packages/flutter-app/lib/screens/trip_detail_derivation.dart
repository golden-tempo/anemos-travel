// The trip-detail screen's derivation pipeline, computed ONCE per input
// signature (specs/perf-program, Wave 4 PR1).
//
// Before this file, every setState on the 6000-line hub screen re-ran the
// whole pipeline inside build() — the tripLegs split ~5-6× and the filtered
// list ~4× per build — on view-only taps (row select, city expand, day
// collapse, filter, Today chip, map day chips, pin tap, booked checkbox,
// section toggles). [TripDerivation] absorbs those method bodies verbatim and
// the State memoizes one instance behind `_derive(trip)`:
//
//   * [TripDerivation.compute] is THE one computation site.
//   * [TripDerivation.matches] is the memo signature: `identical()` on the
//     object inputs (trip, bookingTodos, stays, segments, travelByPos, l10n)
//     plus `==` on the item-order epoch. Identity works as an
//     invalidation signal because every mutation path on the screen replaces
//     its input objects wholesale — EXCEPT `_reorderBatchInline`, the one
//     in-place mutation, which bumps the epoch instead (the stated contract:
//     any in-place mutation of a derivation input MUST bump the epoch).
//   * The lazy accessors ([legFilteredItems], [legFilteredStays],
//     [staysOnNight]) return a stable List identity per (derivation, key) —
//     the map-isolation follow-up (Wave 4 PR2) keys its marker cache on that
//     identity, so keep it stable.
//
// The class is immutable in the docs/zen.md sense: all derived state is
// computed from the constructor inputs and nothing here reads the widget
// tree, providers, or the clock. Time-dependent decisions (today's day, the
// Tonight caption gate) stay in build and query this object
// ([firstGroupKeyForDay], [staysOnNight]).
