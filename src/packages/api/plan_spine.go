// plan_spine.go — the boundary an itinerary write has to clear before anything
// is persisted (specs/shape-before-schedule).
//
// The planner now agrees a trip's SHAPE first and then saves a SPINE: every
// city with one place on the day the traveler arrives and one on the day they
// move on, and the days between deliberately empty. That is a good plan and a
// fragile one. A leg's calendar span is DERIVED from its items' day numbers
// (trip_render_legs.go), so a sparse itinerary rests each city's dates on two
// rows where a dense one had a dozen — and docs/zen.md is explicit that an
// invariant holding only by convention, through rows that can be deleted, is
// not an invariant.
//
// The three refusals below are the mistakes that are MECHANICAL: decidable from
// the tool input alone, with no judgement and no database read. They are
// refused BEFORE the write, so the model retries against an unchanged trip
// rather than reading about the damage afterwards.
//
// Each is scoped to the failure it actually prevents, not to a blanket
// requirement — an over-broad rule here would be the last-day arc's draft two,
// which banned museums on a whole departure day and was rightly disobeyed:
//
//   - end_date missing beside start_date. persistTrip derives a missing end as
//     start + (highest item day) - 1. On a dense itinerary the highest day was
//     the real last day; on a spine it is the FINAL city's ARRIVAL day, so the
//     trip saves days short — a one-city spine saves as a ONE-DAY trip — and
//     because the trip then genuinely ends early, the last-leg trip-end anchor
//     has nothing left to correct it against. Unconditional: whenever the write
//     dates the trip at all, it must date both ends.
//   - a dated trip with an undated place. computeTripLegs takes its item-day
//     branch only when the leg has a dated item AND the trip has a start date;
//     otherwise the leg falls through to the weighted auto-allocation, whose
//     weight is the item COUNT. Every city in a spine has the same count, so
//     that path renders an EQUAL SPLIT of the trip as though it were the nights
//     the traveler agreed to. Scoped to dated trips because on an undated draft
//     a day number dates nothing — which is a legitimate shape the "Add your
//     destinations" rung already exists for.
//   - a MIX of hub-tagged and untagged places. renderHubOf reads city and
//     day_trip_from and nothing else — it deliberately does not parse addresses
//     — so an untagged place among tagged ones becomes its own "Other places"
//     run with its own dates, splitting a city in half. Scoped to the mix
//     because an itinerary with no tags anywhere is one coherent unnamed run,
//     which is exactly what legacy and manually-built trips look like.
//
// Deliberately NOT refused: a city whose places sit on a single day. Under
// the boundary rule (specs/leg-departure-dates) that is an ordinary shape —
// the day is the city's arrival and the leg runs to the next city's arrival
// regardless. (Before the rule it usually meant a missing travel-day place
// and rendered as a collapsed leg.) The shapes that still go wrong on screen
// — two cities sharing an arrival day, a guessed range — get the two honest
// channels instead: the warning line in the tool result (legsRenderSummary)
// and a Trip Health finding (checkLegShape), rather than a guess dressed up
// as a rule.
//
// Coercion is NOT re-implemented here: every check reads the params
// itemParamsFromLocation already produces, so this file and storage cannot
// drift about what "has a day" or "has a hub" means.

// spineRefusalNamesMax caps how many offending places a refusal lists by name,
// so a forty-place payload still returns a readable tool result.
