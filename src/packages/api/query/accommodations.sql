--
-- Upsert on (trip_id, auto_key), NOT a plain insert: "Add details…" may already
-- have created a confirmed row for this leg, and switching winners must rewrite
-- that one row. A second insert would leave the claim-once slot matcher
-- (trip_detail_derivation.dart) holding one and shunting the other into "Other
-- bookings" — visible, confusing, and the exact clutter the shortlist exists to
-- remove. So this deliberately has NO `WHERE accommodations.auto` guard, unlike
-- UpsertDraftAccommodation: choosing overwrites a suggested draft, a dismissed
-- tombstone, and the previous winner alike. One leg, one stay record.
--
-- auto_key is stamped with the todo's STORAGE key and it is load-bearing: the
-- matcher tests `autoKey == 'stay:<label>'` FIRST and only then falls back to a
-- name/address contains against the city label, which "Loft near Old Town"
-- fails. Without the stamp every promoted stay would miss its own leg.
--
-- address/latitude/longitude stay out of the SET so a hand-typed location
-- survives a winner swap; auto=false keeps the row out of sync ownership.
