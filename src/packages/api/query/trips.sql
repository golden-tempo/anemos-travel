-- for a location summary. Legacy trips with NULL chat_id stand alone.
--
-- List-row enrichment invariant: the list payload stays ONE query — anything
-- added here must be a lateral / correlated subquery over indexed FKs (no
-- N+1, no per-trip HTTP fanout). Facts that can't be expressed that way
-- (trip health, the next-step ladder) stay off the list. The shared EXISTS
-- is the HasActiveCollaborators predicate — keep the two in sync.
--
-- Lateral semantics (specs/trips-page-insights):
--   c  — ONE itinerary scan emits both cities and city_pins, so pins are a
--        subset of cities in the same first-appearance order structurally.
--        A hub's pin is its first item by position with non-(0,0) coords —
--        itinerary_items.latitude/longitude are NOT NULL with (0,0) as the
--        no-location sentinel (the computeTripLegs rule); a hub with only
--        sentinel items appears in cities but never in city_pins.
--   bt — booking-todo progress + next_transport_depart, the earliest
--        UNBOOKED future TRANSPORT depart date (the booking-urgency nudge).
--   st — CONFIRMED stays only (auto = false AND NOT dismissed, the
--        ListConfirmedAccommodationsByTrip rule — drafts churn with the
--        itinerary sync and would make the count flap).
--   pk — packing-checklist progress.
--   tb/ex — budget target+currency and PAID expense sum, joined SEPARATELY so a
--        trip with expenses but no budget row still reports spent; currency
--        defaults to USD, matching buildBudgetResponse (single-currency by
--        design — no FX).
