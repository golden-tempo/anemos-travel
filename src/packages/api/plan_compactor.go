//
// When a chat's resent history reaches planCompactThreshold messages, the
// handler folds everything but the newest planCompactKeep messages into a
// short state summary via one cheap non-streamed Haiku call (same forced-tool
// pattern as profile_distiller.go), then runs the turn on
// [summary-as-first-user-message] + kept messages. The summary is streamed
// back to the client (SSE `compacted`), which sends it as PlanRequest.Summary
// on later turns instead of the folded messages — so each stretch of history
// is summarized once, not per turn.

	// planCompactThreshold triggers compaction; planCompactKeep messages stay
	// verbatim. Each turn adds 2 wire messages, so post-compaction turns send
	// 1 (summary) + 10 + 2 and compaction re-fires roughly every 6 turns. The
	// keep window always contains the turn's own user message, which keeps the
	// client's retry flow (drop last user message, resend) from ever cutting
