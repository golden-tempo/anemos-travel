// booking_todo_identity.go — what makes a derived checklist row THE SAME ROW
// across syncs (migration 00064).
//
// A derived leg used to be identified by its endpoint labels:
// `transport:<origin>>><dest>`, where the origin token was whatever the
// renderer had on hand — trips.origin, or failing that the VIEWER's saved home
// airport. Label and identity were the same string, so changing the label
// changed the key, and the prune deleted the row: booked flag, per-leg mode
// override, manual position and the linked expense's source all went with it.
// That fired on an ordinary Settings edit of a home airport, and on any
// collaborator opening a shared trip.
//
// Now the two home legs key on a reserved token whose POSITION carries the
// direction, and the labels are content:
//
//	home_outbound  transport:@home>>amsterdam   origin_label="ALB"
//	home_return    transport:rome>>@home        destination_label="EWR"
//	inter_city     transport:paris>>rome        (key unchanged)
//	stay           stay:paris                   (key unchanged)
//
// Because the key no longer names an airport, changing one is an in-place
// title/label update that UpsertBookingTodosBatch already performs — booked,
// auto and mode are deliberately outside its DO UPDATE set. And because the
// token's position distinguishes the directions, a trip can leave from ALB and
// come home into EWR without the two legs colliding.
//
// The canonical form is computed HERE, server-side, from the posted payload —
// never sent by the client. That is what makes a stale tab, an old cached
// bundle, or a collaborator's device land on the same row instead of pruning
// it, and it is why this change needs no client flag day.
//
// The client is deliberately NOT asked to label its own rows. It would be the
// more direct source ("refuse the temptation to guess"), but a posted role is
// a second writer of identity that every old bundle would omit anyway, so the
// inference below has to exist and be correct regardless — and two paths that
// can disagree is the failure mode this file exists to end. The inference is
// not really a guess: it is a total function of the payload, using the rule
// stayCitySet already applies, over rows the client builds outbound-first and
// return-last.

// homeEndpointToken stands in for "wherever this trip starts or ends" inside a
// derived transport key. `@` rather than a bare word: namesAPlace accepts
// "home" as a city name and would leak it into traveler-facing copy, while `@`
// cannot occur in an IATA code or a Google Places city label — so one prefix
// guard covers every reserved token we ever add.
const homeEndpointToken = "@home"

// The closed vocabulary of booking_todos.role. Home roles are paired with the
// key shape by CHECK constraints (00064), so a wrong canonicalization fails at
// write time instead of storing a plausible-looking wrong row.

// The rule is the one stayCitySet already states for generating copy — a

// stay set never reads as home — promoted here from copy-generation to
// identity, so there is one definition rather than two that can drift. It is
// restricted to the FIRST and LAST transport row because that is
// _deriveTodos' construction order: outbound before the city loop, return
// after it.

// an origin change still lands on the same row.
