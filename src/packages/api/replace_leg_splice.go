// replace_leg_splice.go — the pure, DB-free half of replace_leg: swap ONE city
// leg's places for another city's, with the SERVER owning every position and
// every day number.
//
// Why that ownership is the whole feature. Before this there was no swap
// primitive, so "replace Copenhagen with Belgrade" routed to
// update_itinerary_section scope 'trip' — a whole-trip rewrite in which the
// model hand-authors every position and every day integer. Observed 2026-08-20
// on an eight-city trip: four cities fragmented into duplicate entries and two
// legs' dates moved. The model was not flailing; it was obeying
// update_itinerary_section's own description. A rewrite that re-authors every
// day number cannot avoid moving dates, so the fix has to remove the
// transcription exercise rather than warn about it.
//
// THE INVARIANT. itineraryLocationSchema's `day` description states the
// convention the calendar was built around: "The day the traveler moves
// between cities carries the SAME day number in both — the easy place in the
// city they leave (time_of_day 'morning') and the arrival place in the city
// they reach ('afternoon' or 'evening')." Since specs/leg-departure-dates a
// leg's rendered span is [its own first item day → the NEXT leg's first item
// day], so of a leg occupying days [a..d] it is day a — the arrival — that is
// load-bearing twice over: it dates this leg's start AND the previous leg's
// end. This file preserves [a..d] exactly, which holds every arrival still.
// That is what makes a swap leave every other city byte-identical.
//
// Any `day` the caller sends is DROPPED before anything else looks at the
// place. Assigning days here IS the fix; accepting them would rebuild the bug
// inside the tool built to remove it.
//
// Deliberately no start_date/end_date parameter — see spliceLeg's header for
// why moving the span belongs to set_leg_dates and cannot be made correct here.
//
// Pure: no DB, no I/O, no context, so it is unit-testable without Postgres —
// the discipline planTripRepair already follows. The run split, the hub
// predicate and the location shape are all CALLED from itinerary_repair.go /
// itinerary_section.go rather than restated, so detection and enforcement
// cannot drift apart.
