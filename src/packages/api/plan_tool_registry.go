// plan_tool_registry.go — the /plan agent's tool table. Every tool the agent
// can call is ONE entry in planToolRegistry: the anthropic tool definition,
// an optional availability gate, and a dispatcher. plan_handler.go generates
// the tools slice sent to the API from this registry and dispatches tool_use
// blocks through it; adding a tool means adding one entry here.
//
// ORDER MATTERS: planToolRegistry is an ordered slice, not a map, because the
// tools array is part of the prompt-cache prefix (the system-prompt cache
// breakpoint covers tools + system — see the Wave-6 moving-cache-breakpoint
// work in plan_handler.go). Registry order is the serialization order; keep
// it byte-stable so cache hits survive across iterations and sessions.

// planSession carries the per-request state a tool dispatcher may need:
// which caller this is, what trip (if any) the session is bound to, the SSE
// writer for side events, and the mutable outcomes the handler reads back
// (persisted trip id, whether the profile distiller already fired).
