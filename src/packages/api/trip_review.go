// transport, over budget, unconfirmed bookings, …) by walking the already-
// loaded exportData. NO AI, NO external calls, NO migration: every finding
// traces to persisted data, so nothing here can hallucinate. reviewTrip is a

// checkLegShape flags a city leg whose rendered dates are not the ones anybody

//     arrival day (specs/leg-departure-dates — a leg's end is the NEXT leg's
//     arrival, so only a shared arrival day can pinch a span to nothing). The
//     page draws no nights label at all below one night, and
//     RenderLeg.ZeroNight has ridden the trip payload since the leg-dates work
//     with no consumer anywhere — so nothing else tells anyone. Worse, the
//     booking walk reads a zero-length stay slot as vacuously covered
//     (stayNightsCovered), so Next Step stops asking the traveler to book that
//     city while Trip Health's own night walk still says there is no lodging.
//     This is the finding that makes those two agree.
//   - A leg holds a place dated AFTER the day it ends. Under the old
//     derivation such an item widened its own leg and loudly collapsed the
//     neighbour; under the boundary rule the spans stay plausible while the
//     item sits stranded outside its leg's window, so the derivation names it
//     (RenderLeg.itemsPastEnd) and this finding is what keeps it visible.
//   - A leg's span came from the weighted auto-allocation: no place on it
//     carries a day, so its share of the trip was computed, not chosen. Under a
//     spine every city holds the same couple of places, which makes that split
//     exactly equal — and indistinguishable, on screen, from real dates.
//
// The LAST leg is exempt from the nights check: it legitimately ends on the day
