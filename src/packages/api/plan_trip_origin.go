// DEPARTS from and RETURNS to.
//
// This exists because a traveler asked the chat to fly out of ALB instead of
// EWR and the agent had no tool for it: trips.origin was create-only, the
// in-app create_itinerary hardcoded an empty origin, and the derived
// "EWR → Amsterdam" row is an auto row the booking-todo tools refuse. The only
// lever left was add_booking_todo, so the model added a DUPLICATE and told the
// traveler to ignore the wrong one.
//
// Two airports, not one: this trip leaves from ALB and comes home into EWR.
// They are written together and never inferred from each other — 00064 has the
// reasoning.
//
// What makes changing them safe is migration 00064: a derived leg's identity no
// longer contains its airport, so this is a relabel, not a delete-and-recreate.
